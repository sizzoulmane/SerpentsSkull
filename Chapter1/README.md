# Souls for Smuggler's Shiv (WIP)

[A Series of Dice-Based Events Discord](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder Second Edition (2E)

  - This conversion guide only covers the items that have changed in 2E but not entirely to the Remaster. This includes NPCs and creatures, hazards, XP, treasure, and some tactics where they don't convert well from 1E.
  - The plot, backstory, color text, floor plans, maps, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
  - Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/).
  - Unique and missing 2E creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON, PDF and PNG files are in the statblocks directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available.
  - If you find an issue, error or omission, have a suggestion for improvement, or a better version of something, then post on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/UQ8UD3H) or create a pull request. This is a community project and we welcome and rely on community contributions.

## General GM information

  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
  - DCs are not converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. All other DCs are left to GM discretion. See [level based DCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554) for guidance.

## Party Levelling Milestones
- Level 2: after they've discovered the Jenivere and the Captains log
- Level 3: before they reach the Cannibal Ambush
- Level 4: before they enter the Azlanti Temple

Using Fast Track Advancement, as per the original AP, the target for this book is therefore 3,000 + plus random encounters = 3200-3xxx level adjusted XP.

[Full Level to Wealth Chart](http://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=581)

This adventure contains all [treasure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atMQxRgSKBF4xaGR8UK_2yB75FY9n85B/edit?gid=216243941#gid=216243941) for 1st through 4th levels.

As a general rule divide the gp values of valuables by 10 to convert to 2E. Occasionally they are divided by 20 in order to fit the 2E wealth guidelines. 

All magical items in 1E treasure are replaced by 2E items in this guide.

It's assumed that even though NPCs may use consumable items in their possession, those items will still become part of the loot. If you decide not to do this, you should replace it with something else (or just increase the cash value of currency items).

Spellbooks (if any) are valued at 50% of the cost of "learn a spell" for the highest-level spells only, usually those currently memorized by the NPC.

Treasure was provided for a party of 4. If you have additional party members, include additional treasure and items per the "Full level to Wealth Chart" and accompanying information linked above.

There is no spare treasure. If your players miss something early on in the adventure, you should include additional items later.
